Dave Cross has been programming professionally since 1988 and using Perl since 1996.

He is the author of <em>Data Munging with Perl</em> (Manning, 2001) and a co-author of <em>Perl Template Toolkit</em> (O’Reilly, 2003). He has also written articles about Perl for <em>The Perl Journal</em> and <em>Linux Format</em>.</p>
<p>Dave has run training courses on Perl since 2001. He has run in-house courses for companies ranging from investment banks to dotcoms and he regularly runs public courses in London.

He is a regular speaker at both Perl and open source conferences.</p>
<p>Dave has been heavily involved in the Perl community for many years. In 1998, he founded the London Perl Mongers, the first Perl Users’ Group in Europe and he lead the group for its first four years.
